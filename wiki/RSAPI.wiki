#summary Implementation of Rollout Sampling Approximate Policy Iteration

= Introduction =

Rollout sampling approximate policy iteration is a policy iteration algorithm that uses intelligent sampling of a Markov decision process via rollouts, so as to minimise the amount of time spent simulating to obtain an improved policy.
