#summary The Bayesian variable order Markov model

This is a family of methods that perform Bayesian inference on variable order Markov models.

= Efficient implementation =

  * ContextTree - The BVMM
  * ContextTreeBMC - The Bayesian Markov chain
  * ContextTreeCTW - A naive CTW implementation
  * ContextTreePPM - The PPM-C.

context_tree_test.cc - test sequence prediction

= Old implementation (deprecated) = 

This one uses a stl/map for every depth (so D of trees of depth 1, ... , D) instead of an actual tree structure of depth D and so is very slow and memory hungry.
